Gildas the Wise or Gildas Sapiens
De Excidio Britanniae
Epistole
Also surviving is Historia Gildae

Authors who quote Him
Bebe - Historia Ecclesiastica
Alcuin - Died 804 quotes him by name of Sapientissimus
Geoffrey - References non existing book
Bale - From a Scriptorum reference
Pits - From a Scriptorum reference
Usher - From a Scriptorum reference
Tanner - From a Scriptorum reference
Caradoc - Wrote the life of Gildas (Although no references exist before the time of Henry VIII)

A lot of the text is working to emphisize how much worse the old Roman empire of yesterday was compared to what it is like today in the new Byzantium Empire.

I also like the note the translater noted about Gildas confusing the meaning of the latin word Tyrant with that of usurper.  Usurper is a 14th century french word.

1305            Pophyry dies as the most recognized philosopher in Europe

15th Century    Oldest version of Epistola Gildae ammended to a copy Historia
				The Jesuits create the forgeries of Eusebus, Gildas, Bede, Alcuin and Geoffrey in order to stem any resistance to Christianity by giving it a history over 1200 years old.  It has always been that way and you can not change it so just accept it.
				Gildas and Geoffrey are likely the same writer.
				Claims are made that Constantine Censored all of his work for critizising christians
17th Century	Jean Hardouin - being a latin grammer nazi calls out the forgeries
