In the reference section, there is heavy reliance on Matthew, Luke and most heavily referenced Psalms.  The references to Psalms are used equally to say something good or bad happened, the fact that somebody wrote a song about it is proof.  In most references that include both luke and matthew, it is a positive statement. When referencing matthew alone, it is in reference to enduring pain or hardship.
