Argonautic Expedition - Some stars in Aries marked the equinox ending the year.  in 1689 newton calculated that was 2627 years ago, about 70 years after kind solomon.  It is also dated by Hipparchus using Aries, he uses 1 degree every 100 years.  Counting back from Nabonasser 602 and addin 11 degrees = 792 years give 43 years after the death of solomon

*** Edwin Johnson
In his book, "Rise of Christendom" 1890
Franciscan friars occupy Capitol of Rome in 1250 which was occupied by the Benedictines not much before the end of the 12th centiry
They build a church on the very site of the Temple of Jupiter signifying the transition from old Roman to the Medieval worship.  Details remain wrapped in profound obscurity
History is full of absurdities.  Emperors who become theological madmen, - To be fair they had been raised since birth with plumbing from lead pipes

The orders of St Basil and St Benedict laid down the basis on which all Church literature was to be contrived and constructed

Ecclesiastical History ascribed to Nicephorus Callistus said to have been written early in the fourteenth century http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0450-0450,_Salaminus_Hermias_Sozomenus,_The_Ecclesiastical_History_[Schaff],_EN.pdf
Compare with Ecclesiastical History ascribed to Eusebius Pamphili (said 3rd century) https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.88338

The church wrote invented Dante
Economy or Dispensation of Christ 	Said to be 3rd century, time of Constantine but was actually written in far in the Middle Ages				
									Based solely upon a theory of Apostolical Succession
Synagogue system dates from the period between Rabbi Samuel the Nagid of Cordova and R. Moses Maimonides a Spaniard who settled in Cairo 1000-1200



*** Anatoly Fomenko
New Chronology

A well known Russian Mathematician and Member of the RAS.  
Using statistical analysis, Fomenko proposes a date for Ptolemy's Algamest said written in 100 AD.  Due to the uniform distortions in groups of stars movement, he determined the star locations were collected between 600 AD and 1300 AD.  They conclude that when published in the medieval ages the stars were moved to where they calculated the stars should have been in 100 AD.

In studying the Lunar orbits in the 1970s, he noticed problems with the equations nasa used.  The orbit speeds up about 1000 years ago and slows back down in the early BC.
